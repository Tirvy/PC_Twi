PC_Twi
======

PC version of Twilight Imperium boardgame (3rd edition).

As a team of two friend we made this game in a far-far 2014. It had (and probabaly can still support) CLI in the beginning. Then we used Panda3D (panda3d.org) engine for graphics. It was going well. Until we had to make netcode.
